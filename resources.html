                <dt>Be thoughtful!</dt>
                    <dd>After making your appointment with the Writing Center, take some time to reflect on the goals you hope to achieve through your tutoring session. Do you have specific concerns about content, the strength of your argument, or formatting,? Make sure to jot them down so you can share your notes with your assigned or chosen consultant.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Be ready!</dt>
                    <dd>Make sure to bring everything pertinent to the assignment with you if your appointment is in-person, and have it readily accessible if you are meeting online. Appointments go by faster than you’d think, and searching through your folders takes up time that should be spent making your paper as great as it can be. Make sure you have enough time between the due date and your appointment to make revisions!</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Be engaged!</dt>
                    <dd>Your appointment should be a dialogue, not a lecture. Your consultant  isn’t teaching you the best way to write a paper; they are helping you write the paper your way! Make sure to outline your intentions and brainstorm with your consultant so that they can assist you in creating your strongest paper yet!</dd>

                <dt>Our COVID-19 Response</dt>
                    <dd>The CNU Writing Center is dedicated to fighting COVID-19 while still giving you the same in-person tutoring experience that you’re used to! We require masks and social distancing for both consultants and clients, and all in-person appointments will run one-on-one in tutoring spaces that follow the University guidelines.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>What to expect</dt>
                    <dd>During your appointment, your consultant might lead you through a brainstorming session to find a strong topic, a close revision of your first draft, or any number of organizational techniques like outlining, storyboarding, or post-outlining. You can also request that your consultant look over your final draft and help add some additional polish. Either way, the CNU Writing Center will be there for every step of your writing process!</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Some things to note:</dt>
                    <dd>- Appointments are 45 minutes for in-person sessions, and an hour for online synchronous sessions.</dd>
                    <dd>- Running late? Consultants will wait 10-15 minutes before requiring that the appointment be rescheduled. </dd>
                    <dd>- All clients must follow university mask-wearing and social distancing safety guidelines.</dd>
                    <dd>- Due to COVID-19 precautions, the CNU Writing Center will not be accepting drop-in appointments at this time. </dd>
                    <dd>- If you have any questions, you can contact the CNU Writing Center by emailing wcenter@cnu.edu or Dr. Nicole Emmelhainz (nicole.emmelhainz@cnu.edu)</dd>

                <dt>Need more than one appointment?</dt>
                    <dd>You can schedule one appointment a day, as many times a week as you need. If you aren’t scheduling in advance, there will be an opportunity to do so at the end of your first session, which will be encouraged by your consultant!</dd>

                <dt>Your Laptop</dt>
                    <dd>Make sure to bring your laptop so your consultant can assist you with writing and organizing the paper in real time, so you don’t forget all of the advice before implementing it!</dd>
                <br>
                <dt>Context</dt>
                    <dd>While our consultants are well trained in Writing Center work, the staff doesn’t represent all the majors CNU offers. Therefore, when you attend your appointment, make sure to bring all of the resources necessary to provide context and understanding of the assignment for your consultant. If you are writing a lab report, bring in your lab notes and the assignment description. If you are drafting a business plan, make sure to include some notes so that you can brainstorm the organization with your consultant! </dd>
                <br>
                <dt>An Open Mind</dt>
                    <dd>It isn’t easy to let your work be analyzed, but make sure to work with your consultant in strengthening it instead of against them. They know what they’re doing, and they are only interested in helping you do it, too!</dd>
