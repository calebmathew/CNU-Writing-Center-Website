            <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p>The Alice F. Randall Writing Center’s mission is to strengthen the literary skills of each of our clients through external peer support and resources, not simply by correcting errors, but by encouraging clients to employ certain writing behaviors based on their strengths and writing style. Whether this occurs by engaging in brainstorming activities, learning what makes a good argument, or advice on overall structure, clients will be encouraged to become the best version of themselves instead of modeling a textbook approach. We offer assistance for a wide variety of writing projects and experience levels, so any CNU student can find help with their project.</p>

            <h4>Inclusivity Statement</h4>
            <p>At the Alice F. Randall Writing Center, we know that it is our duty to recognize and celebrate the English Language in all forms and dialects, as well as the wide variety of writers that will come through our doors for assistance. We are dedicated to bettering Christopher Newport University as an academic environment not simply by condemning intolerance, but by continuously adapting to promote comfort, accessibility, and inclusion for all of our students. We employ a diverse peer-to-peer tutoring system in order to maintain a progressive standard of equality and excellence for our clients, as well as a safe space for personal growth and expression.</p>

                    <p>As Writing Center Director, I believe in the benefits of community-oriented support for writing. Conversation and collaboration are at the heart of writing; all three are part of what makes us human. When students feel supported and encouraged, they will develop their writing skills -- and just maybe, enjoy the process too! In addition to my Writing Center work, I’m also the Writing Program administrator and teach a variety of writing-intensive courses, including: Poetry Writing; Grant Writing and Public Relations; Writing for the Professions; and Writing for the Digital Humanities.</p>
